Vftrace can be installed using autotools.

autoreconf -if
./configure CC=<your_C_compiler> CXX=<your_C++_compiler> FC=<your_Fortran_compiler> --prefix=<install_path>
make
make check
make install

Consult ./configure --help for information about available options.
The most important ones are:
   --enable-fortran        Enable fortran interfaces for user functions
                           and MPI if MPI is enabled (default: enabled).
   --enable-fortran08      Enable fortran08 interfaces for MPI
                           if MPI is enabled.
                           (default: enabled)
   --enable-mpi            Enable MPI profiling for C, Fortran, and Fortran08.
                           (default: disabled)
   --enable-openmp         Enables usage of OpenMP in profiling. This is currently
                           without effect. See README for more information.
                           (default: disabled)
   --enable-dynlib-tracing Allow tracing of instrumented libraries
                           that are dynamically loaded at runtime via dlopen.
                           This option must not be enabled if CUpti CUDA profiling is used.
                           (default: disabled)
   --enable-self-profiling Enables Vftrace to profile itself
                           while it profiles an application.
                           This option is not intended for end users,
                           but only for Vftrace developers.
                           Activating this option will massively slow down
                           your program execution.
                           (default: disabled)
   --with-cupti=DIR        Specifies the CUpti installation directory.
                           Enables Vftrace to trace usage of CUDA
                           to gather information about GPU usage and
                           memory transfer.
                           This option must not be used if dynlib-tracing is enabled.

Further Advice:

Autotools does not resolve the dependencies of Fortran modules. For this reason, building with more than one thread (make -j) can lead to problems. We advice to always use one thread.

Vftrace comes with an elaborate set of tests. Users are advised to run `make check` to ensure that Vftrace was build correctly. Note that failure of some tests (especially MPI) do not mean that Vftrace is broken, or not correctly installed, but can hint at errors in the MPI implementation. We have informed MPI developers about all known issues.
